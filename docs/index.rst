Welcome to Hello's documentation!
=================================

The `Hello` project is a playground, demonstration and template for other project repositories.
It provides a "Hello, world!" program, written in Python, with all bells and whistles.

The features demonstrated so far are:
  - Python project layout with `pyproject.toml` and setuptools.
  - Command line interface with Click.
  - Documentation with Sphinx.

The ToDo list for future features includes:
  - Requirements management with Sphinx Needs.
  - Testing, most likely with pytest.
